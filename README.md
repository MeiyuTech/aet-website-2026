# AET Website 2026

A Next.js App Router website for American Education and Translation Services, with a homepage, Evaluation, Certified Translation, and shared Pricing page. Built with TypeScript, responsive CSS, and small client-side enhancements. Ready to import into Vercel as a Next.js project.

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20.9 or newer and pnpm 9.7.1.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3021. The development port is configured in `package.json`.

## AET Eval (local workspace)

AET Eval runs at `/admin/eval` in the `x/aet-eval` worktree. Set the server-only
`EVAL_*` values from `.env.example` in `.env.local`, then run `pnpm dev:eval` and
open `http://localhost:3023/admin/eval`. The separate port avoids the website's
normal development server. Restart after changing environment values.

The workspace uses project `qrxztgdemfodemlcabcq` (`jhaccounting.org & AET`),
including the migrated reports, versions, conversations, conversion rules, and
private `aet-eval-attachments` bucket. Schema changes are in `supabase/migrations`.
Existing remote migrations are already applied; do not re-import the original
snapshot after editing live reports. The migration verifier compares the original
exported columns and intentionally fails if original data has since changed.

Reports open as directly editable HTML documents. Click a report field to change
it in place. Fields, AI assistant, and History are collapsible tools beside the
report (above it on phones). The canvas and field panel share one unsaved draft;
closing a panel also preserves the unsent AI message. Print preview switches the
report to clean, read-only pages. Use Save report to persist edits.

Features include report search, applicant/credential/course editing, GPA totals,
document notes and signatures, history restore, reversible archive, private image
attachments, paginated preview/printing, Word export, and reviewable AI proposals.
PDF import prepares a draft for review before applying. Neither PDF import nor AI
suggestions save the report automatically. Conversion rules are read-only reference
material; the inherited HTML Editor GPA scale includes A+=4.35. Existing report
totals are preserved until grades/credits or course membership are changed, or
explicitly recalculated. Editing course titles does not replace reviewed totals.

Employee login is deferred. Both pages and APIs require development mode,
`EVAL_LOCAL_ENABLED=true`, and a loopback host; `dev:eval` binds to localhost.
Production mode always rejects access. The admin layout excludes public analytics.
Credentials stay server-side. Do not remove these gates before staff access is
implemented. The private bucket and evaluation tables have no client-role access.

AI requires a funded Gemini project. PDF contents, current report context,
messages, and selected images are sent to Gemini only when the user invokes the
corresponding action. The initial model is `gemini-3-flash-preview`, configurable
with `EVAL_GEMINI_MODEL`. The inherited API key currently returns billing error
402 (credits depleted); successful live parsing and AI replies must be rechecked
after its billing is restored or a replacement key is configured.

Run `node scripts/check-eval.cjs` for synthetic checks of GPA, allowed AI changes,
legacy field compatibility, validation, signature restrictions, and access gates.

## Validation and deployment

```sh
pnpm check:i18n
pnpm typecheck
node scripts/check-blog-contact.cjs
node scripts/check-payment.cjs
```

Local production builds are not run under the project instructions. The owner manages deployment and the hosted production build.

Import this directory's repository into Vercel and choose the Next.js preset. The
Payment page requires the server-only `PAYPAL_BUSINESS_*` and `PAYMENT_SITE_URL`
values documented in `.env.example`. Stripe Checkout uses `STRIPE_PAYMENT_MODE`
(`test` or `live`) and separate server-side credentials for each account/mode.
California/Miami use `STRIPE_{TEST,LIVE}_SECRET_KEY`; Boston/NYC use the same
names with `_BOS`. No credential fallback is allowed. Live mode removes test
copy and requires an HTTPS `PAYMENT_SITE_URL`. Local development remains in test
mode. Production defaults to disabled unless its mode is explicitly configured.
See [payment integration notes](content/payment/README.md) for setup, verification
and the manual reconciliation boundary. Git pushes do not upload `.env.local`.
Other public pages need no API keys or database.
Deployment is intentionally left to the owner.

## Analytics

The shared locale layout loads Google tag `G-7SF10M7GBE` with `next/script`
after hydration on all English, Chinese, and Spanish pages. Keep a single
installation. GA4 enhanced measurement must include browser-history page changes
to track client-side navigation. Authored Blog phone and Contact-page buttons
also send `contact_us` with article, locale, method and placement. Same-tab web
links wait for the event callback or a separate two-second fallback; telephone
and new-tab actions retain native behavior. Other Blog click objects remain in
`dataLayer`. These events measure contact intent, not completed inquiries.
GA4 receipt, key-event settings and Google Ads import still need account verification.

## Scope

The complete institution directory is available at `/institutions`,
`/zh/institutions` and `/es/institutions`. It preserves 28 legacy entries across
four categories, with localized search, filters and complete application notes.
The homepage carousel links locally and the legacy partners PHP URL redirects.
See [institution content provenance](content/institutions/README.md).

About AET is implemented at `/about`, `/zh/about`, and `/es/about`, with a shared
history timeline, service highlights, archival photo gallery and client collection.
The footer uses the localized route and five legacy About entry points redirect
there. See [About content provenance](content/about/README.md).

The homepage uses a shared `app/[locale]/page.tsx` template with Next.js i18n
(`next-intl`) for English, Chinese, and Spanish. English uses `/`; Chinese and
Spanish use `/zh` and `/es`. Migrate each additional page once through this same
locale architecture; language variants do not require separate page implementations.

Application and pre-evaluation buttons connect to the existing
app.americantranslationservice.com portal. Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and Beijing
office pages are local at `/offices/{miami,boston,los-angeles,beijing}`, with
English, Chinese and Spanish variants. The localized Contact page is implemented. A localized Payment page is available
at `/payment`; its form supports the existing PayPal HTML-form handoff and an
optional Stripe Checkout. The header and
footer link to the localized page, and `/e-pay.php` redirects there. Production environment configuration, deployed return routes and office payment
reconciliation must be verified before client use.

The Blog index is available at `/blog`, `/zh/blog`, and `/es/blog`, with 80
retained articles and one new CSLB guide. Credential evaluation is the primary topic:
its 29 articles appear by default, with other topics in a secondary selector.
All 81 articles are local at `/blog/[slug]`; 157 legacy PHP/HTML article URLs
redirect to them. The 80 retained bodies remain English-only across locales,
without language-availability notices. The CSLB guide has complete English,
Chinese, and Spanish versions with localized titles and search metadata.
Shared navigation and index controls stay localized. Cards and page titles use each source body's heading; the original
metadata titles remain in the source catalog for provenance. `/blog/` and
`/blog/index.php` redirect to `/blog`. Local migration is complete; publication
review of dated claims and production cutover remain open. See
[blog source and verification notes](content/blog/README.md).

Pricing is implemented at `/pricing`, `/zh/pricing`, and `/es/pricing`. The
Services menu and footer use these localized routes. `/e-fee.php` redirects to
`/pricing`, preserving the legacy section anchors for retained services.

Evaluation is implemented at `/evaluation`, `/zh/evaluation`, and `/es/evaluation`.
It preserves legacy prose and reuses Pricing's table component and shared rates.
The homepage/header/footer use these routes, and the three legacy evaluation PHP
URLs redirect to them. Original form and sample PDFs are served locally.
See [content provenance](content/evaluation/README.md) for source details.

The CSLB guide is a Blog article at `/blog/cslb-foreign-credential-evaluation`,
in English, Chinese, and Spanish, with an entry on each Evaluation page. The former `/evaluation/cslb` paths
redirect to the article in the same interface language and preserve query strings.
It covers education credit, document requirements, AI reading links, and contact
before ordering. See [authored content notes](content/blog/authored/README.md).

Certified Translation is implemented at `/certified-translation`,
`/zh/certified-translation`, and `/es/certified-translation`. It uses the shared
service-page shell, Pricing records, mobile card rails, and the legacy three-step
email workflow. The three legacy notarized PHP entry points redirect to it.
See [service-page template](docs/service-page-template.md) before adding services
and [translation provenance](content/certified-translation/README.md) for sources.

The production origin is `https://www.americantranslationservice.com`, confirmed
by the owner on September 30, 2026 and centralized in `lib/seo.ts`. Canonical URLs,
Open Graph URLs, language alternates and sitemap entries use this origin even
in local previews. Vercel preview deployments emit noindex metadata. Every
`*.vercel.app` alias also receives an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow` header,
including the stable alias for a Vercel production deployment. The host-specific
rule does not disable indexing on the official custom domain. Other public
preview hosts need equivalent noindex configuration before publication.

The complete legacy URL inventory is in `docs/seo-legacy-urls.md`. On October 1,
the owner deferred unmigrated legacy content and PDFs for possible future pages;
they are not current tasks or release blockers. Preserve their source inventory.
Search Console ownership verification remains a launch task. Known retained entry points redirect to local routes;
removed services are not silently redirected to the homepage. See the SEO checklist
for verification and remaining launch work.

## Service scope

The Services menu retains the following services (Visa restored by owner request on October 10, 2026):

- Certified Translation
- Technical Translation
- Interpretation
- Expert Opinion Letters
- General Translation
- Notarization
- Visa Services

Editing/Proofreading and China Consular Authentication are removed
from the rebuilt website's desktop/mobile navigation, homepage service cards,
and footer wherever previously listed. Do not reintroduce their labels or links
when copying content from the legacy website. Foreign Credential Evaluation,
its evaluation types, and Pre-Evaluation Services remain available.

This scope applies to this rebuilt homepage; it does not delete legacy website
pages or change the separate application portal.

## Documentation

## Existing action destinations

- Application: https://app.americantranslationservice.com/credential-evaluation-application
- Preliminary assessment: https://app.americantranslationservice.com/degree-equivalency-tool

Validate routes, metadata, and the intended deployment before launch. Do not submit applications, contact forms, or payments during link checks.

## Editing

- `app/[locale]/page.tsx`: shared homepage structure and service links.
- `messages/en.json`, `messages/zh.json`, `messages/es.json`: localized interface and homepage content.
- `i18n/routing.ts`: supported locales and locale URL behavior.
- `app/globals.css`: base responsive styles and motion. Reduced-motion preferences are respected.
- `app/reference-style.css`: shared AET surfaces, photo treatment, and logo presentation.
- `app/home-design.css`: final design-guide typography, spacing, responsive rails, and native menu styling.
- `components/card-rail.tsx`: progressive previous/next controls over native horizontal scrolling.
- `components/scroll-stories.tsx`: fact selectors and process imagery, with unpinned reduced-motion and no-JavaScript fallbacks.
- `components/navigation.tsx`: mobile navigation, language links, and progressive scroll reveals.
- `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`: localized layout and page metadata.
- `public/images/`: locally copied assets; see ASSETS.md.

Poppins, Fraunces, and Gaegu are hosted locally in `public/fonts/` and loaded through `app/fonts.css`. Font licenses and provenance are documented in ASSETS.md. Native details elements keep FAQs functional without JavaScript. Page content remains visible if JavaScript is disabled.

## Internationalization

Locale routing uses `next-intl`: `/` (English), `/zh` (Simplified Chinese), and
`/es` (Spanish). An explicit locale URL takes precedence; otherwise the saved
`AET_LOCALE` preference is used, followed by the browser language and English.
The preference cookie lasts one year. `/en` updates the preference and redirects
to `/`, so English remains selectable after visiting another locale.

The header language selector is available on desktop and mobile. Switching keeps
the current pathname, query parameters, and fragment. Home and logo links stay in
the active locale. Imported HTML uses `lib/content-links.ts` to preserve that
locale on internal page links; downloads and English-only legal URLs stay
language-neutral. Held article references retain their text without a link.
External references and the separate application portal keep their destinations.

Edit corresponding keys in all three `messages/*.json` files. Missing messages
fall back to English; development logs and `pnpm check:i18n` report omissions.
The check also validates message syntax, interpolation arguments, and preservation
of the original English testimonials. Translated reviews are labeled as translations;
brand artwork, institution names, and existing application screenshots are retained.
Localized titles, descriptions, HTML language attributes, absolute canonical URLs
and HTML alternate-language links are supplied. Alternates include only genuine
translations and always use the confirmed production host. English-only blog and
career variants, and untranslated service fallbacks, canonicalize to English and
use noindex outside English; only indexable variants appear in the sitemap.
Legal pages retain their English-only redirects.

After moving routes, run `pnpm exec next typegen` if existing generated route types
still reference the old paths, then run `pnpm typecheck`. This does not build the site.

## Legal documents

`/privacy` and `/terms` use a shared reading layout and the complete English
legacy text in `content/legal/`. Legal documents are English-only in every site
language. Footer and Payment links point to these English routes; former Chinese,
Spanish and legacy legal URLs redirect with section anchors preserved. Visiting
a legal page does not change the saved site language. See
[source provenance and launch review](content/legal/README.md) for the operational
statements that still require owner review.

## Shared pricing

`lib/pricing.ts` is the single source for USD fees, price types (fixed, starting,
range, or quoted), units, turnaround, shipping/tracking, and minimum durations.
The baseline is the owner's September 29, 2026 updated legacy `e-fee.php`, not
the conflicting older service-page or application-form prices. The owner requested
removal of the document-language notice and Chinese-price-list link from Pricing.

`components/pricing/pricing-table.tsx` renders any catalog rate collection;
`components/pricing/pricing-section.tsx` renders a complete reusable service
section with its qualifications. Future service pages should import these
records/components rather than copying prices into page copy. Expert Opinion
Letters and Professional Experience Evaluation share the same rate records.
The homepage fee, standard turnaround, and FAQ interpolate the shared
Document-by-Document values. `lib/pricing-format.ts` handles localized price and
time display; `messages/*.json` contains wording, not fee or turnaround values.

Example: `<PricingSection section="translation" />` or
`<PricingTable rates={expertOpinion} caption={localizedTitle} showService={false} />`.

Visa fees are now included from the legacy Visa Service pages, as requested on
October 10, 2026. `visaFees` supplies the source prose, service tables, Pricing
page and structured offers. The introductory China starting fee and Q2/L starting
fee remain distinct. Consular/application charges are separate from AET fees;
Canada's application-plus-shipping total is derived. See
[Visa provenance](content/visa-service/README.md). Other Services includes translation, proofreading, and
English writing, as confirmed by the owner. Their rates and the proofreading
discount threshold share the pricing catalog.
No application-form-only add-ons have been imported. Existing old-site service
pages and the separate application portal are outside this shared data module.

## Shared office information

Edit `lib/contact.ts` to update public office addresses, phone numbers, email
addresses, messaging channels, or business hours. The four office detail pages,
six-office Contact directory, map directions and payment recipient mailing
addresses read this catalog. `components/offices/office-card.tsx` is the shared
contact module; office detail pages use its expanded layout. Office names and
field labels live in `content/contact/{en,zh,es}.json`, and the shared office-page
copy lives in `lib/office-content.ts`.

Imported article/service HTML passes through `lib/contact-html.ts` so reviewed
contact literals resolve against the same catalog. `content/contact/legacy-references.json`
is an immutable spelling map for imported source text, not a place to edit current
business details. Historical images are unchanged. New imports with additional
contact spellings must extend this map. Payment identities (Zelle/PayPal/bank
accounts) stay separately configured and must not follow general contact email edits.

Footer office links and Contact's Office details links use the localized office
routes. Legacy `e-office-{slug}[{-zh,-es}].php` and `.html` URLs redirect there.

## Structured data

`lib/structured-data.ts` generates Organization, LocalBusiness and Service graphs.
`components/structured-data.tsx` safely serializes them into server-rendered JSON-LD.
Homepage/About identify the organization; Contact describes all six offices; each
local office page describes its branch. Seven retained service types use the shared
provider ID. Untranslated service fallback pages omit duplicate service markup.

Office postal fields in `lib/contact.ts` also generate the existing English display
address; edit these fields when updating an address. Localized Beijing addresses
remain in the same record. Existing social links are shared with the footer through
`lib/organization.ts`; generic search links are not organization identity links.

Service offers read the visible shared rates from `lib/pricing.ts`, including
estimated/starting/range prices, units, turnaround and applicable minimums. Do not
add a second pricing table inside the schema module. Run
`python3 scripts/check-structured-data.py` against the existing local server to
check JSON parsing, Schema.org properties, entity references and visible facts.
The script uses Python's standard library and downloads the official vocabulary;
`--vocabulary /path/to/cached.json` supports a previously downloaded copy.
Google rich-result eligibility and post-deployment inspection remain separate checks.

### SEO maintenance checks

Use the existing preview. Restart it after changing the redirect configuration.
Export configured redirects without a production build:

```sh
node -e 'require("next/dist/server/config").default("phase-development-server",process.cwd()).then(async c=>require("fs").writeFileSync("/tmp/aet-redirects.json",JSON.stringify(await c.redirects())))'
python3 scripts/check-content-links.py --url http://localhost:3021
python3 scripts/test-blog-fragments.py
python3 scripts/check-blog.py --url http://localhost:3021
python3 scripts/check-preview-indexing.py
python3 scripts/check-seo.py --redirects /tmp/aet-redirects.json
python3 scripts/check-structured-data.py
python3 scripts/inventory-legacy-seo.py --redirects /tmp/aet-redirects.json
```

`check-content-links.py` checks imported HTML and all 299 page variants for old
body links, locale consistency, direct local destinations and valid fragments.
`check-seo.py` checks sitemap/canonical/hreflang, sharing image dimensions,
redirect destinations/queries/anchors, fallback noindex and legacy 404 behavior.
`check-structured-data.py` checks Schema.org vocabulary and visible facts.
Use `--base-url` for a different preview. The inventory script reads the sibling
legacy checkout; it does not execute PHP or alter the old site.

For public staging, pass `--expect-noindex` to `check-seo.py` and `check-blog.py`.
The indexing test uses Host headers against the local server to verify both
Vercel aliases and official-domain behavior. Blog HTTP parity uses the actual
contact renderer; static source hashes independently protect imported prose.
Avoid repeated hosted bulk crawls if Vercel responds with a security checkpoint;
record the blocked scope and complete local checks without bypassing protection.

Sharing cards are committed PNGs under `public/share`, so serving them does not
require a font service or image-generation endpoint. After page title changes,
regenerate them with `python3 scripts/generate-share-images.py` (Pillow required).
The script defaults to macOS Arial/Arial Unicode fonts; use `--font` and
`--cjk-font` with available equivalent fonts elsewhere. Fonts are rasterized,
not copied or redistributed. The unchanged AET logo follows ASSETS.md.

`content/blog/schema-images.json` selects existing inline article imagery of at
least 50,000 pixels, excluding archived reports, reviews, certificates and logos.
Recheck image relevance against the article when its content changes. Missing
verified author, image or date information stays absent from Article markup.
The publication dates continue to come from the original-source date catalog.

### AET Eval architecture and roadmap

See [the refactor checklist](docs/aet-eval-refactor-checklist.md) for the current
module structure, dependency boundaries, preserved behavior, verification evidence,
and the document-driven Agent roadmap. See [Agent setup](docs/aet-eval-agent.md)
for OpenAI configuration and the required generation worker. Run `pnpm check:eval` for synthetic,
network-free domain, server-contract and module-boundary checks.
